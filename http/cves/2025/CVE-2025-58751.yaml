id: CVE-2025-58751

info:
  name: Vite Dev Server - Path Traversal
  author: wn147
  severity: low
  description: |
    Vite is a frontend tooling framework for JavaScript. Prior to versions 7.1.5, 7.0.7, 6.3.6, and 5.4.20, files starting with the same name with the public directory were served bypassing the `server.fs` settings. Only apps that explicitly expose the Vite dev server to the network (using --host or `server.host` config option), use the public directory feature (enabled by default), and have a symlink in the public directory are affected. Versions 7.1.5, 7.0.7, 6.3.6, and 5.4.20 fix the issue.
  impact: |
    Attackers can access unauthorized files bypassing filesystem restrictions, potentially exposing sensitive data.
  remediation: |
    Update to versions 7.1.5, 7.0.7, 6.3.6, or 5.4.20 or later.
